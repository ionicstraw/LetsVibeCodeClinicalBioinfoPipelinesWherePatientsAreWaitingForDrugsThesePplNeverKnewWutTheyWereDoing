# LetsVibeCodeClinicalBioinfoPipelinesWherePatientsAreWaitingForDrugsThesePplNeverKnewWutTheyWereDoing

all from the mind of a loser who updates his own wiki page and follows ppl on twitter/bluesky so they follow him back to bring up his follower count

CAN WE EXPECT ANYTHING ELSE AT THIS POINT lol sad

The person who co-wrote that Vibe Coding paper, pure garbage paper btw, updates their own Wikipedia page ðŸ˜‚: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nicholas_Tatonetti&action=history , they're "Cyberpuke" but they never updated Jason's page rotfl this is SO FUNNY
